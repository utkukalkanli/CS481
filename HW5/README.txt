You can run the code by typing "make all" or "make test" 
Make test runs the code in the configuration of examples on the slides.
The result is not exactly the same as in the pdf example. But it is the same logic and it should be fine.

There are some additional test inputs names test_sequences.fasta and test_sequences.aln. they are used in "make test". If you don't need them just ignore.
